# Himera Him: Autonomous Neural-Quantum Ecosystem

**Himera Him** (v8.0) is a next-generation decentralized network built on **Rust**, engineered to survive the post-quantum era and transform computational power into collective intelligence.

## 🛡️ Core Breakthroughs
* **Post-Quantum Immunity:** Secured by **CRYSTALS-Dilithium5** lattice-based signatures, making the network resilient against quantum computer attacks.
* **Proof-of-Learning (PoL):** A sustainable alternative to PoW. Mining power is used to train AI models (Weight Aggregation) instead of solving useless hashes.
* **Global Brain Architecture:** Distributed weight-aggregation system that evolves the network's intelligence with every processed block.
* **Neural Fund:** A built-in 0.15% metabolic tax for automated self-development and AI research.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Rust (Nightly)
* **Cryptography:** CRYSTALS-Dilithium5
* **Compression:** LZ4 (for ultra-fast delta-weight sync)
* **Structure:** Neuro-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for parallel processing.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/satnov-nak/Himera-Core.git
cd Himera-Core
cargo build --release
```

### Running a Node
```bash
./target/release/himera <p2p_port> <api_port> <db_file> <wallet_file>
```

## 📜 Vision
Himera is not just a blockchain; it is a digital organism. By merging quantum security with decentralized AI, we are building the foundation for a **Sovereign Artificial Intelligence**.
